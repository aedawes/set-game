# SET
### Ana√Øs dawes

This is my game of set.  Here you can play a full game where you match cards 
to make a set and clear them out until you have fully completed the deck!

## What went well
- I was able to use multiple enums for card properties as well as the card state which kept everything organized
- I used a generic method in my model to help me evaluate sets
- It turns out that they key for the game logic for a game of set is the use of the Set datastructure!  Sets can store completely unique values so I can determine whether a card's properties are either all unique or all the same
- I spent a lot of time on the UI to make sure it was neat and tidy
- I commented a lot throughout to keep things organized
- I made efforts to ensure my coding styles were consistant
- I spent a lot of time on animation at a speed that is easily understood by the user
- I learned a lot about what went into the model vs what went into the view model.  I was very confused about that before
- I used an extension for Arrays to be able to find a specific index of a card
- I created a scoring system to keep track of the users score based on how many matches they made and how many cards were dealt at the time of match
- I created an indicator to tell the user how many matches they made

## What did not go well

- It took me a long time to figure out how to simplify my code
- I am not sure my code is as clean as it can be but it is clean to my current ability
- I struggled getting the columns to auto size 
- I struggled to animate things because too much code was in my model rather than my view model initially
- I feel like some things are a little too redundant or hard coded

### Overall Thoughts

I feel like with the amount of work I put into this, I deserve full points or at least an A.  I learned a LOT not only about swift through this project but about clean coding practices in general.  A lot of coding classes I feel like I am just going through the motions, happy to have something to guide me to practice more but through projects like this, I feel like I am actually really improving fast!
